### TODO LIST

---

- [ ] Integrating the Payment Gateway to get the payment done (for balance)
- [X] Handling the negative balance and stopping transactions when required. Also, for adding negative balances (-123), there needs to be a validation to prevent.
- [ ] Rate limiting the usage for safety.
- [ ] Additional cost column for custom tools. (start + continuation)
- [ ] Real PostgreSQL DBMS integration.
- [ ] Real e-mail SMTP integration.
- [ ] HTTPS Configuration for the application + CORS configuration.
- [ ] Real media management with AWS S3 Storages (e.g. profile pictures, organization images, etc.)
- [ ] Better validation and logging system.
- [X] Partial page refresh for permission additions, since it is tiring. If it does not work, instead use forms to save and update
- [ ] Deploy / DEBUG to PRODUCTION changes and possible updates for the better usage.
- [ ] Privacy Policy and Terms of Service development & integration for the application.

### QUICK FIXES

- [X] Add the page to include users to other organizations / remove them.
- [X] Add an active field to permissions. When the user is deactivated, the permissions are also deactivated. When the user is reactivated, the permissions are also reactivated.
- [X] The LLM models are all over the place, they are not unique to the organization anymore. Either we need to change how balance calculation works in the transactions page, or we need to make the LLM models unique to the organization.
- [X] Handle the additional information in the registration page.
- [ ] Integrate the chat deletion page and functionality.
