### QUICK FIXES

- [ ] Implement the Browsing tool for the web browser & web scraping features.
  - [ ] Browsing must have a choice to select "data cautiousness": "high", "medium", "low".
  - [ ] Browsed pages must be stored in a knowledge base for future reference. 
  - [ ] A data model for the browsed pages must also be designed.
  - [ ] Admin model + save() and save_model() methods must also be needed to integrated.
  - [ ] The browser plugins must be installed: scraper? + driver? + parser?
  - [ ] There must be a page for the users to see the metadata stored pages (summarized form only).
  - [ ] Implementation of the prompt for the browsing tool.
  - [ ] Integration of the prompt to the chat.
  - [ ] Testing within the chat and evaluation of the performance.
