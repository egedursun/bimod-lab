### TODO LIST

---

- [X] Handling the negative balance and stopping transactions when required. Also, for adding negative balances (-123), there needs to be a validation to prevent.
- [X] Rate limiting the usage for safety.
- [X] Real media management with AWS S3 Storages (e.g. profile pictures, organization images, etc.)
- [X] Partial page refresh for permission additions, since it is tiring. If it does not work, instead use forms to save and update
- [ ] Integrating the Payment Gateway to get the payment done (for balance) + credit card safety / storage and usage
- [ ] Real PostgreSQL DBMS integration.
- [ ] Real E-mail SMTP integration.
- [ ] Stop Sequence Integration
- [ ] HTTPS Configuration for the application + CORS configuration.
- [ ] Better logging system.
- [ ] Deploy / DEBUG to PRODUCTION changes and possible updates for the better usage.
- [ ] Privacy Policy and Terms of Service development & integration for the application.
- [ ] Proper Documentation & tutorial, instructions (FAQ and Support) for the application.
- [ ] Exclude the media from Git versioning (IMPORTANT!!)
- [ ] Fix the main search bar for having correct redirection links.
- [ ] Integrate paginations and global searches for the relevant pages.
- [ ] Docker compose YAML file design.
- [ ] GitHub work-flows for CI/CD and integration testing with the application on the cloud.
- [ ] Development of the unit and integration tests for the application.
