................................

**BIMOD.IO SMART CONTRACTS**

[1] Add server time to the UI on website.
[2] Implement the views & templates for the Wallet Connection data model.
[3] Test the wallet balance synchronization method.
[4] Implement a latest transactions retrieval method (IF POSSIBLE).
[5] Implement the views & templates for the Smart Contract data model.
[6] Visual Fixes & Tweaks for the Wallet Connection & Smart Contract data models.
[7] Implement the Smart Contract executor.
      [a.] Implement the contract creation prompt.
      [b.] Implement the contract syntactic check prompt.
      [c.] Implement the contract refinement prompt.
      [d.] Implement the contract cost-effectiveness prompt.
      [e.] Implement the contract evaluation & scoring prompt.
      [f.] Implement the prompt builder function(s).
      [g.] Implement the basic logic of the contract generation function.
      [h.] Implement the iteration logic for the contract generation function.
      [i.] Implement the contract deployment function.
[8] Test the contract generation feature.
[9] Test the contract deployment feature.
[10] Contemplate over the functions in the contracts, should AI generate caller buttons to instantiate those functions?
      [a.] Check if it is helpful.
      [b.] Check if it is feasible with AI consultancy.
      [c.] Check if it is easy to implement.
      [d.] If so, implement the feature.
      [e.] These calls must have their own page & view: Detail Smart Contract View, which can be accessible from the 
            Smart Contract List View (with a redirection button).
      [f.] Test the function calls to see if they work or not.
      [IDEA]: Along with putting function execution button(s), there can be a tool connection page, for connecting the
              contracts as tools to existing BimodLab assistants, and they can use this tool to initiate function calls
              to smart contracts.
[11] Add notifications application.

**NEXT PROJECT-0: PAYMENT GATEWAY INTEGRATION**

- *PAYMENT GATEWAY*: Integration of a payment gateway to the web application, allowing for the clients to pay for the
                      services they use in the application.
  - *Details:* TBD

---

**NEXT PROJECT-1: BINEXUS**

- *BINEXUS*: Self-Replicating Swarm Intelligence Multi-Modal AI Network

**NEXT PROJECT-4: ASTROLITH X1**

- *ASTROLITH X1*: Two important plans to be developed: A physical server + a locally runnable instance of the 
                      Bimod & BimodLab web application, with minimal interventions from our ends. 
                      **(Probably with Licence Key and Encryption)** Once option will be hardware+standalone software,
                      the other option will be a software-only solution. The balance will be one-time with burnout of
                      of the software after a certain period of time and balance depletion. In the hardware included
                      model, new firmware will be installed then.
