### TODO LIST

---

- [ ] Integrating the Payment Gateway to get the payment done (for balance)
- [X] Handling the negative balance and stopping transactions when required. Also, for adding negative balances (-123), there needs to be a validation to prevent.

- [ ] Additional cost column for custom tools. (start + continuation)
- [ ] Real PostgreSQL DBMS integration.
- [ ] Real e-mail SMTP integration.
- [ ] HTTPS Configuration for the application + CORS configuration.
- [ ] Real media management with AWS S3 Storages (e.g. profile pictures, organization images, etc.)
- [ ] Better validation and logging system.
- [X] Partial page refresh for permission additions, since it is tiring. If it does not work, instead use forms to save and update
- [ ] Deploy / DEBUG to PRODUCTION changes and possible updates for the better usage.
- [X] Privacy Policy and Terms of Service development & integration for the application.
- [ ] Stop Sequence Integration
- [ ] A better payment method management (for credit card storage and usage).

### QUICK FIXES

- [X] Add the page to include users to other organizations / remove them.
- [X] Add an active field to permissions. When the user is deactivated, the permissions are also deactivated. When the user is reactivated, the permissions are also reactivated.

- [X] Integrate the chat deletion page and functionality.
- [X] Connect user message creation form.
- [X] Connect assistant response framework.
- [X] Test the flow of chat.
- [X] When the chat is created the first time, there is a bug preventing the user message to be sent.
- [X] Fix the documentation page and include content.
- [X] Fix the FAQ page and include content.
- [X] Transactions must also include the responsible user, to associate the costs with the users.
- [X] Show a loading bar while the message response is being calculated.
- [X] Show the messages in mark-down format.
- [ ] Refine ideas regarding the dashboard page.
- [X] Add memory objects to the permission management.
- [ ] **URGENT:** Add the API endpoint not only when the server is started, but also when an endpoint is created.
- [ ] **URGENT:** Limit the number of exportations users can create for API.
- [ ] **URGENT:** Implement the rest of the pages for the export assistants application.
