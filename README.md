**NEXT PROJECT-2: ASTROLITH X1**

  **(Probably with Licence Key and Encryption)** Once option will be hardware+standalone software,
  the other option will be a software-only solution. The balance will be one-time with burnout of

  such as functions, APIs, scripts, and other things to manage the organization completely autonomously.
  - *Details:* TBD

---

**NEXT PROJECT-9: DEVELOPER ECOSYSTEM**

  incentivize them by rewarding Bimod & BimodLab credits, as well as a commission percentage from
