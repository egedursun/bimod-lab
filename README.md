### TODO LIST

---

- [ ] Integrating the Payment Gateway to get the payment done (for balance)
- [ ] Handling the negative balance and stopping transactions when required.
- [ ] Protecting the actions with the permissions, for every page of the application.
- [ ] Rate limiting the usage for safety.
- [ ] Registration for new tenants.
- [ ] Additional cost column for custom tools. (start + continuation)
- [ ] Real PostgreSQL DBMS integration.
- [ ] Real e-mail SMTP integration.
- [ ] Better validation and logging system.
- [ ] Partial page refresh for permission additions, since it is tiring. If it does not work, instead use forms to save and update
- [ ] For adding negative balances (-123), there needs to be a validation to prevent.
- [ ] Deploy / DEBUG to PRODUCTION changes and possible updates for the better usage.

### QUICK FIXES
