    # TODO-RETRIEVAL: As can be guessed, there are several things that needs to be considered on retrieval:
    #       - Before generative search:
    #           - The assistant needs to have a "limit" for the objects to retrieve.
    #           - The assistant needs to have a "specific graphQL query" to retrieve the objects.
    #           - The assistant needs to have an "alpha" value, determining the semantic similarity of the objects.
    #           - There can be other additional things.
    #   You need to explain the assistant how to perform the queries, and explain how to accomplish the usage
    #   of this task.
