                    have one, and visiting the account settings section that allows you to manage Your personal

                  <h5>Disclosure of Your Personal Data</h5>
                  <h5>Business Transactions</h5>
                  <p>If the Company is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, Your Personal Data may be
                    transferred. We will provide notice before Your Personal Data is transferred and becomes subject to
                    a different Privacy Policy.</p>
                  <h5>Law enforcement</h5>
                  <p>Under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to disclose Your Personal Data if required
                    to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g. a court or a government
                    agency).</p>
                  <h5>Other legal requirements</h5>
                  <p>The Company may disclose Your Personal Data in the good faith belief that such action is necessary
                    to:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Comply with a legal obligation</li>
                    <li>Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company</li>

                  </ul>
                  <h5>Security of Your Personal Data</h5>
                  <p>The security of Your Personal Data is important to Us, but remember that no method of transmission
                    over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While We strive to use
                    commercially acceptable means to protect Your Personal Data, We cannot guarantee its absolute
                    security.</p>
                  <h5>Children's Privacy</h5>
                  <p>Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally
                    identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. If You are a parent or guardian and You
                    are aware that Your child has provided Us with Personal Data, please contact Us. If We become aware
                    that We have collected Personal Data from anyone under the age of 13 without verification of
                    parental consent, We take steps to remove that information from Our servers.</p>
                  <p>If We need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing Your information and Your country
                    requires consent from a parent, We may require Your parent's consent before We collect and use that
                    information.</p>

                  <p>Our Service may contain links to other websites that are not operated by Us. If You click on a
                    third party link, You will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise You to review
                    the Privacy Policy of every site You visit.</p>

                  Task processing times may vary based on the complexity of the task and server load. In fact, there
                  might be multiple different causes for a delayed response, such as network latency, the performance
                  of your internal database servers, or the SSH server’s response time. Check the task’s
                  configuration for any potential inefficiencies. If delays persist, consider optimizing the assistant’s
